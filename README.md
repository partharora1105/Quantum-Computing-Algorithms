<h2>Implementation of Quantum Computing Algorithms and Applications such as decrypting the RSA Encryption</h2>
<p>
In this repository, you will find implementations of some of the most well-known quantum algorithms, including:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Teleportation Circuit:</b> This is a protocol for transmitting an unknown quantum state from one location to another, using only classical communication and local operations.</li><li>

<b>Bernstien Vazirani Algorithm:</b> This quantum algorithm can determine the value of a hidden Boolean function with just one evaluation of the function. Given a function f(x) that takes as input a bitstring x and outputs a single bit, the algorithm determines the value of f(x) for any given x with a single evaluation of the function, rather than the classical approach of evaluating the function for each possible value of x. This makes the Bernstien Vazirani Algorithm more efficient than classical algorithms for certain tasks.</li><li>

<b>Deutsch Algorithm:</b> This algorithm can determine whether a given function is constant or balanced with just one evaluation of the function.</li><li>

<b>Shor's Algorithm:</b> This algorithm is used for factorizing large integers, which is believed to be computationally hard for classical computers but can be done efficiently on a quantum computer.</li>
</ul>
In addition to these algorithms, this repository also includes implementations of quantum algorithms for solving real-life problems, such as:
<ul>
<li>
<b>Search algorithms:</b> Quantum computers can perform certain types of searches more efficiently than classical computers, making them useful for tasks such as database searching and optimization problems.
</li><li>
<b>Decrypting RSA:</b> RSA encryption is widely used to secure internet communications and is based on the assumption that factoring large numbers is computationally infeasible. However, Shor's Algorithm can be used to efficiently factorize large numbers on a quantum computer, potentially allowing for the decryption of RSA-encrypted messages.</li>
</ul>
